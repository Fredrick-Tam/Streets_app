# Streets_app
This webapp shows you city information and a street view image of the given input. 
It hugely relies on AJAX requests made to New York Times, Wikipedia and Google street view images to give adequate information 
about a particular residence.
This project was the last challenge on Udacity for the AJAX tutorial and my model provides a good and simplified approach.
** This is just the MVP (minimal viable product), will be working on a more extensive model in future and will be commiting 
changes ASAP **
